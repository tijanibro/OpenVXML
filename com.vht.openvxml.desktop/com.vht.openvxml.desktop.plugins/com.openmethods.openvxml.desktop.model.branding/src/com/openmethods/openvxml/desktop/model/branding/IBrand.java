 * A brand represents a layer of configuration within an application. Brands are
 * arranged into a hierarchy and support a form of inheritance. Typically, child
 * brands should inherit any configuration or settings available to their parent
 * brand. There is no limit to the number of branches in the brand structure.
 * 
 * This class holds the information for a single brand. It tracks the parent
 * brand and any children this brand has. It also maintains an index of the
 * media providers available to this brand.
