/**
 * The <code>EventHandler</code> class is the base class for the family of VXML
 * elements that process events and errors that are generated during execution
 * of a VXML document. Each instance contains a list of actions for the
 * interpreter to perform if the event handler receives an event. These actions
 * are written to the VXML document in the order they were added. There are two
 * optional methods to govern whether the event is received by the event handler
 * instance. A conditional expression can be specified that must evaluate to
 * true at the time the event is generated for the event handler to be notified
 * of the event. Also, an event handler can declare that it only needs to be
 * notified if it is the n<sup>th</sup> occurrence of the event by setting the
 * count field. Each of these options can be employed separately or together.
